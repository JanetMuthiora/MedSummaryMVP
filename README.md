Here’s a beginner-friendly technical breakdown of your current backend code and project setup, suitable for sharing with a product owner:

Project Progress Overview
What Has Been Done
Express Server Setup

We have created a Node.js backend using the Express framework.
The server listens on port 3001 for incoming requests.
API Endpoint for Summarisation

There is a POST endpoint at /api/summarise.
This endpoint receives clinical text from the frontend, sends it to OpenAI’s API, and returns a summary.
OpenAI Integration

The backend uses the OpenAI Node.js SDK to connect to the OpenAI API.
The model used is gpt-3.5-turbo (as gpt-4 was not available for this API key).
The API key is securely loaded from an environment variable.
CORS and Body Parsing

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled, allowing the frontend (even if served from a different port) to communicate with the backend.
The server can parse JSON request bodies using body-parser.
Error Handling

If the OpenAI API returns an error (e.g., quota exceeded, invalid model), the server logs the error and returns a 500 status with an error message.
Key Areas to Improve
OpenAI Quota/Billing:
The current API key has exceeded its quota. The app cannot generate summaries until billing or quota is resolved.
Frontend/Backend Integration:
The backend is ready, but the frontend should be served from a local server (not just opened as a file) for best results and to avoid CORS issues.
User Feedback:
The frontend should display clearer error messages to users if the backend returns an error (e.g., quota exceeded).
Security:
Ensure the .env file with the API key is never committed to version control.
Testing:
Automated tests for the API endpoint are not yet implemented.
Next Steps for Testing
Resolve OpenAI Quota/Billing

Check the OpenAI dashboard for usage and billing.
Add funds or upgrade the plan if needed.
End-to-End Testing

Start the backend server:

node src/server.js
Serve the frontend (medsum.html) using a local web server (e.g., live-server or http-server).
Paste clinical text in the frontend and click "Generate Summary".
Confirm that a summary is returned and displayed.
Error Handling Testing

Test with empty input and invalid requests to ensure errors are handled gracefully.
Automated Testing (Optional)

Add unit tests for the /api/summarise endpoint using Jest or another testing framework.
Summary
The backend is set up and integrated with OpenAI.
The main blocker is the OpenAI API quota.
Once resolved, the system can be tested end-to-end.
Further improvements can be made in error handling, security, and automated testing.
